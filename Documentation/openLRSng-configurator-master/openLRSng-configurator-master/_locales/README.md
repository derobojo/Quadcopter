Translators
-----------
1. - Please follow the string <strong>order/flow</strong> inside en/messages.json as this is the default translation file from which all translations should originate.
2. - If you have trouble translating certain string, you can either skip it (still following the usual order/flow) or you can join #OpenLRS irc channel on freenode and ask one of the devs to add description to the string/text to make translating easier.
3. - <strong>Never</strong> pull request translation file that contains "emtpy" message string, missing translation strings will always default to english translations.
4. - Always <strong>validate</strong> the json file before making a pull request as error in messages.json will break the application.
5. - All pull requests for translations need to be made agains the <strong>development</strong> branch, pull requests agains master branch will be <strong>declined</strong>.
